    <H3>Phases (detail) (2020)</H3>
    <H7><a href="guests.html#mareikeyinyeelee">Mareike Yin-Yee Lee</a> (at KINDL &ndash; Zentrum für zeitgenössische Kunst)</H7>
    <p>Across the surface of the elevated glass box in KINDL, Mareike Lee spatializes enlarged elements from <a href="festival2020.html#jamestenney">James Tenney</a>’s score <i>Phases</i> and creates a room that glows from within with coloured light. This is in response to and an elaboration of Tenney’s sense of form being the result of structure and their relation in space (also on the page). A hybrid installation, the graphic “postal pieces’ scores will be projected via overhead projector onto a window of the glass box. </p>

    <H3>Aggregates and Processes (2020)</H3>
    <H7><a href="guests.html#mareikeyinyeelee">Mareike Yin-Yee Lee</a> (at KM28)</H7>
    <p><i>Aggregates and Processes</i> is a series of 13 posters: a tribute to <a href="festival2020.html#jamestenney">James Tenney</a>’s inclusive, vibrant and inspirational artistic community. This is a pluralistic collection to honour Tenney’s keen visual sense, and his diverse and curious appreciation of and collaboration with a vast array of composers, visual artists, and friends. The poster images (drawings, photos, scores, words), both archival and newly created, are contributed by Tenney’s colleagues and close inspirations. Lee has worked closely with Lauren Pratt (Tenney’s partner) to source these. Lee enlarged and adapted the material as needed, and reproduced them on poster matrices whose colours echo the colours of Tenney’s <i>Postal Pieces</i> scores. Images, work, writings, etc., are heterogenous, and include contributions from Carolee Schneeman, <a href="orchestra.html#catherinelamb">Catherine Lamb</a>, <a href="orchestra.html#chiyokoszlavnics">Chiyoko Szlavnics</a>, <a href="orchestra.html#marcsabat">Marc Sabat</a>, Walter Zimmerman, et al. The posters are hung spatially in a wavy line echoing forms in Tenney’s scores.</p>

    <H3>View (2019)</H3>
    <H7><a href="orchestra.html#fredrikrasten">Fredrik Rasten</a></H7>
    <p><i>View</i> is a piece for cello in 13-limit just intonation and was written for cellist Émilie Girard-Charest in 2019. The performer of the piece uses a curved bow (Bach-bogen) to produce dyads and triads, melody and counterpoint. The top string of the cello is tuned down to create a neutral third &ndash; 11/9 with the lower adjacent string, and this neutral third is a recurring pivot point from which the music bifurcates into denser harmonic fields. The piece was composed using a guitar that could resemble the specific cello set up &ndash; namely a 4-string fretless acoustic guitar played with a violin bow. <i>View</i> can be actualized on such an instrument, and in this way it is a part of an ongoing project of extending the prospect of the guitar as an instrument apt for tuning issues and sustained sound.</p>

    <H3>V1 (2020)</H3>
    <H7><a href="orchestra.html#moabbott">M.O. Abbott</a></H7>
    <p><i>V1</i> was composed for the Harmonic Space Orchestra in spring 2020, intended as the first in a series of works focused on trichords wherein two pitches are easily tuneable to a third pitch, but not to each other. In <i>V1</i>, these trichords are made larger by adding tuneable first-order sum and/or difference tones, resulting in chords with 4&ndash;7 total pitches. The net effect is that each larger chord has two subsets (which share one common tone) that are relatively easy to tune in isolation, but difficult to tune when all pitches are sounding. Entrances are staggered in each large chord in an effort to more easily facilitate the possibility of precise tuning. The chords are linked together by a series of common tone modulations, on a stochastic journey through James Tenney's model of harmonic space. Variations in orchestration and register over the course of the piece provide further dimensions for contemplation.</p>

    <H3>Partial Response (2000)</H3>
    <H7><a href="orchestra.html#chiyokoszlavnics">Chiyoko Szlavnics</a></H7>
    <p>Partial Response was the precursor of the compositional method that came to me in 2003: producing beautiful line drawings as the basis of my work. This was my first (and only!) purely graphic score (from which musicians perform), and I created it using a now-obsolete graphic notation program, called "Notewriter", which enabled me to work with extended lines, and place visual elements however I pleased. This piece was my second exploration of ratio-related intervals. But it was my first scoring of extended sustains, slow glissandi, and intentional beating. It opened up the path for the many compositions that followed, for over a decade, from 2003&ndash;2014, all of which first appeared as line drawings.</p>

    <p>For this solo acoustic guitar performance, so sensitively and carefully prepared by <a href="orchestra.html#fredrikrasten">Fredrik Rasten</a>, the original score for three musicians has been adjusted to accommodate the single timbre of the guitar, and in response to some of the physical challenges the material presents, like playing simultaneous glissandi, or using multiple ebows. The resulting magical music is very close to the heart of my musical aesthetic &ndash; i.e., sinewaves &ndash; but the interpretation and physicality of Fredrik playing his guitar makes some of my favourite sounds truly alive.</p>
