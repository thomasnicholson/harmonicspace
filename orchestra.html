    <H1>Harmonic Space Orchestra</H1>
    <p>The Harmonic Space Orchestra was originally initiated in 2016 by composers/performers based in Berlin with rational intonation at the core of their practices. In 2018-19, the experimental, research-based group began to grow and to meet weekly, through the material/repertoire inherent to its members—approaching precisely tuned sound-forms in a pluralistic manner. They agreed upon the name in early 2020 as an homage to James Tenney, employing his influential term that suggests a radical shift in perception around elemental musical experience.</p>

        <p class="right">Catherine Lamb (b. 1982, Olympia, WA. U.S.) is an active composer exploring the interaction of tone, summations of shapes and shadows, phenomenological expansions, the architecture of the liminal (states in between outside/inside), and the long introduction form. She began her musical life early, later abandoning the conservatory in 2003 to study Hindustani music in Pune, India. She received her BFA in 2006 under <a href="festival2020.html#jamestenney">James Tenney</a> and Michael Pisaro at CalArts in Los Angeles, where she first developed her research into the interaction of tone and continued to compose, teach, and collaborate with musicians (such as Laura Steenberge and Julia Holter on Singing by Numbers). In 2008 she received a W. A. Gerbode Foundation and W. & F. Hewlett Foundation Emerging Composers initiative for Dilations, premiered at the Other Minds festival in San Francisco. She mentored under the experimental filmmaker/Dhrupad musician Mani Kaul until his death in 2011. In 2012 she received her MFA in music/sound from the Milton Avery School of Fine Arts at Bard College in New York. She toured Shade/Gradient extensively and was awarded the Henry Cowell Research Fellowship to work with Eliane Radigue in Paris. In 2013 Lamb relocated to Berlin, Germany where she lives currently, and has written for ensembles such as Konzert Minimal, Dedalus, Ensemble neoN, the London Contemporary Orchestra, as well as the JACK Quartet; while collaborating regularly with <a href="orchestra.html#marcsabat">Marc Sabat</a>, <a href="orchestra.html#johnnychang">Johnny Chang</a> (Viola Torros), Bryan Eubanks, and <a href="orchestra.html#rebeccalane">Rebecca Lane</a>. Her first orchestral work, Portions Transparent/Opaque, was premiered by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at the 2014 Tectonics Festival in Glasgow and was conducted by Ilan Volkov. She completed a series of nine pieces entitled Prisma Interius (2016-18) in which the infinite opening filter from inner to outer perceptions are deeply explored. In 2019 she co-founded the collectively oriented Harmonic Space Orchestra in Berlin. She is a 2020 recipient of the Ernst von Siemens Composer's prize, a 2018 recipient of the Grants to Artists award from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, a Staubach Fellow for the 2016 Darmstadt Summer course as well as a 2016-2017 Schloss Solitude Fellow.

    <p>Rebecca Lane is a musician who explores intonation, focusing on the experiential qualities of sound, but also on phenomena which only emerge through specific ways of working together. Thus her practice is informed by ongoing relationships and collaborations with composer-performers (such as Catherine Lamb, Marc Sabat, Clara de Asís and Samuel Dunscombe) and within ensembles using various flutes (flutes, quarter-tone flutes, recorders) and occasionally voice. She has also worked with Eva-Maria Houben, <a href="orchestra.html#chiyokoszlavnics">Chiyoko Szlavnics</a>, Sarah Hughes, Antoine Beuger, André O.

        <p class="right"> Thomas Nicholson finds himself guided by many practices from a wide range of fields and periods &ndash; these include mathematics, typography, graphic design, Renaissance artwork, and web development. He studied composition with Christopher Butterfield and piano with Arthur Rowe at the University of Victoria (Canada). In 2017, he moved to Berlin to study at the Universität der Künste with Marc Sabat, whom he assisted in teaching intonation theory. His compositions since 2014 have examined the interaction between counterpoint (melodies), harmony (chords), and the unique gradations of spectral fusion evoked through microtonal just intonation (auditory perception). He composes primarily for smaller settings of musicians and occasionally collaborates on film and installation. His is actively researching as well as developing tools and methods for navigating the practical challenges of realising microtonal music on acoustic instruments &ndash; strings, in particular. His awards and honours include prizes from the SOCAN Foundation for my compositions MOTTE and ABOUT (2017) as well as SOCAN’s John Weinzweig Grand Prize (2017), the DAAD Prize from the Universität der Künste Berlin (2018), and a feature in CBC Music’s 30 hot Canadian classical musicians under 30 (2018).</p>

        <p>Fredrik Rasten (born 1988) is a guitarist and composer based in Oslo and Berlin. He is primarily focusing on the musical possibilities within just intonation and related sound phenomena, and in his work he is reaching for an actively listening state wherein to intuitively explore the complexities of tone and harmony. On the guitar he is applying real time retuning of the instrument, vocal shadings and different preparations to create warm and fluctuating resonances. As a composer he is mostly creating music for smaller groups, where the ongoing exploration of pitch relations is guiding the work, while also finding inspiration in early music, folk traditions and reductionist / silent expressions. Other elements influencing his work include ideas of music as social, non-hierarchical practices, and essential philosophical conundrums, such as the elusive relationship between mind and matter. He has collaborated with musicians such as Catherine Lamb, Antoine Beuger, Marc Sabat, Taku Sugimoto, Andrea Neumann, Magda Mayas, Christian Wallumrød and Alasdair Roberts, and has toured extensively in Europe and Russia with the long-term groups Oker, Pip and Arches. Rasten's recording output has been published on labels such as SOFA, Edition Wandelweiser, Ftarri and Shhpuma.</p>

        <p class="right">Canadian composer of Ukrainian descent Marc Sabat (*1965) has been based in Berlin since 1999. He makes pieces for concert and installation settings, drawing inspiration from ongoing research about the sounding and perception of Just Intonation. He relates his practice to various music forms—folk,experimental and classical. In collaborations with others he seeks points of shared exploration and dialogue between different modes of experience and cultural traditions. Largely self-taught as a composer, Sabat studied violin at the University of Toronto, at the Juilliard School in New York, and computer music at McGill University, as well as working privately with Malcolm Goldstein, James Tenney and Walter Zimmermann, among others. With Wolfgang von Schweinitz he developed the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation and is a pioneer of instrumental music written and performed in microtonal Just Intonation. In 2000, he co-founded the Plainsound Music Edition website, conceived as a curated, interdisciplinary virtual artists’ edition. Sabat’s work is played internationally. He teaches composition and the theory and practice of intonation at the Universität der Künste Berlin. Together with colleagues Catherine Lamb and Rebecca Lane he formed the Harmonic Space Orchestra in 2019.</p>

        <p class="right">Chiyoko Szlavnics is a Canadian composer and visual artist, whose practice is based in Berlin. She began composing after graduating from university music studies in Toronto in 1989, and studied privately with James Tenney from 1993-7. A generous Fellowship Grant from the Akademie Schloss Solitude took her to Germany in 1997, after which she moved to Berlin and joined its fertile international experimental music community. Chiyoko Szlavnics composes for acoustic instruments, and also for sinewaves, and sometimes combines the two. Around the year 2000, she developed a compositional approach based on self-generated drawings. The drawings enabled her to conceive and realise a kind of music, which promotes the perception of certain psychoacoustic phenomena (beating and combination tones), through her sensitive setting of ratio-related pitch material in sustains and extended glissandi, and her careful orchestration. Drawing became an independent artistic practice around the year 2010. She has created numerous "moiré" series, which have been exhibited internationally. Beyond upcoming composition projects and further drawing series, Szlavnics also dreams of creating a new series of "sinewave sculptures". Chiyoko Szlavnics's compositions have been performed at venues great and small. Her preferred performance and installation venues are those with extraordinary resonance.</p>
