    <a id="mareikeyinyeelee"></a>
    <H3>Mareike Yin-Yee Lee</H3>
    <p>Mareike Yin-Yee Lee’s multidisciplinary practice encompasses drawing, video, sculpture, found and made objects, printmaking, and artist books. Current works include installations, recordings and live performances produced in collaboration with musicians and composers with an emphasis on the relation between sight and sound. How we approach, perceive and respond to these form the basis of her recent works‘ manifestations. Her immersive, site-specific installations explore the complex and tenuous nature of communication and how we experience space, drawing on gesture, sound, and memory to elicit responses that cannot be put into words. She redefines the architecture and temporality of the spaces in which she works. Lee’s work plays with the spaces between, across, and beyond, embracing the undefinable and subtle gradations, forging a language of colour, tone and space that seeks to articulate microcosms of daily life and sustained contemplation.Lee studied at Universität der Künste, Berlin, Germany; University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; and Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Nova Scotia, Canada, where she was awarded the Joseph Beuys Scholarship and the Canada Millennium Award of Excellence. Recent projects include exhibitions and performances at Kunsthaus Kule Berlin (2020), Kunstmuseum Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen Magdeburg (2019), Galerie Kunstpunkt Berlin (2018), Kunstbezirk Stuttgart, Kunst(zeug)haus Rapperswil- Jona Switzerland (2017), Kunsthaus Interlaken (2017), Neuer Kunstverein, Aschaffenburg (2016), and KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin (2016).
