        <p>Mareike Yin&#8209;Yee Lee’s multidisciplinary practice encompasses drawing, video, sculpture, found and made objects, printmaking, and artist books. Current works include installations, recordings and live performances produced in collaboration with musicians and composers with an emphasis on the relation between sight and sound. How we approach, perceive and respond to these form the basis of her recent works‘ manifestations. Her immersive, site-specific installations explore the complex and tenuous nature of communication and how we experience space, drawing on gesture, sound, and memory to elicit responses that cannot be put into words. She redefines the architecture and temporality of the spaces in which she works. Lee’s work plays with the spaces between, across, and beyond, embracing the undefinable and subtle gradations, forging a language of colour, tone and space that seeks to articulate microcosms of daily life and sustained contemplation.Lee studied at Universität der Künste, Berlin, Germany; University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; and Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Nova Scotia, Canada, where she was awarded the Joseph Beuys Scholarship and the Canada Millennium Award of Excellence. Recent projects include exhibitions and performances at Kunsthaus Kule Berlin (2020), Kunstmuseum Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen Magdeburg (2019), Galerie Kunstpunkt Berlin (2018), Kunstbezirk Stuttgart, Kunst(zeug)haus Rapperswil- Jona Switzerland (2017), Kunsthaus Interlaken (2017), Neuer Kunstverein, Aschaffenburg (2016), and KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin (2016).</p>

    <H3>Helge Slaatto</H3>
    <p>The Norwegian violinist Helge Slaato (born 1952), since 1993 professor at the Musikhochschule in Münster, Germany, before that concertmaster of the Odense Symphony Orchestra in Denmark, has given concerts throughout Europe, often with works composed specially for him. He made his successful debut in Oslo in 1977 with a pure solo violin programme, a rarity at the time. In London in the 1970'ies &ndash; together with pianist/conductor Jan Latham-Koenig and the Koenig Ensemble &ndash; he championed  works by Janacek, Poulenc and Szymanowski, and the encounter with Hans Werner Henze and the Cantiere Internazionale d'Arte in Montepulciano, where Helge Slaatto was a regular guest for many years, was of lasting importance.</p>
    <p>His teacher, the late Sandor Vegh, was a great influence, not only as far as the classical repertoire was concerned. Veghs collaboration with Bartok was a decisive inspiration: Helge Slaatto's recording of the Bartok solo sonata (2002, ambitus 96847) was highly praised by the press. Berlingske Tidende wrote: ”Rarely has a work for solo violin sounded so convincing!”  and other corner stones in the 20ieth century repertoire, like the works by Berg and Schoenberg, in particular the latter's string trio, are among his favourites (e.g. Schoenberg String Trio recorded by Trio Slaatto).</p>
    <p>The performance of Scelsi's violin concerto ”Anahit” with the Koechlin Ensemble for the Süddeutsche Rundfunk led to further involvement with contemporary music, both as orchestral musician and as soloist. For many years Helge Slaatto was concert master of Athelas Sinfonietta Copenhagen, and the Danish composer Svend Hvidtfelt Nielsen composed a violin concerto for Helge Slaatto and the Randers Chamber Orchestra, as well as a suite for solo violin, shortly to be released on the Danish label Dacapo.</p>
